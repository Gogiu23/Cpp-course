# Variables

In programming, a variable is a way to store a data and associate a name with it.
Every variable have 3 aspects:
- **Identifier** = the name of the variable;
- **Type** = the gender of the variable;
- **Value** = the value of the variables (could be a number or a chain of 
characters);

> **Declaration of variable**

```cpp
    int n(4);
    int n_car;
```
In C++ we can declare a variable and no assign any value.

> **Initialization**

When we initialize a variable we actually assign a initial value from start.
If as the example before we declare a variable without initialize it, 
that variable can contain any value. That means the result if higly unpredictable
and probably wrong and unespected. That's why **always we have to initialize** a 
variable before use it.

### In generals

> ***type*** **identification**(***value***);

Once the variable is defined, the type cannot be changed anymore.
