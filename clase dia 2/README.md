# First program C++
## We write the first very program in cpp

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	cout << "Hello world!" << endl;
	return 0;
}
```
- **cout** = is asociate to the standard ooutput to the console.
- **endl** = it means we jump the line at the end of the code.

> Everithing associate to the library of cpp \<iostream\>

We always compile program as
```
g++ -Wall introduccion.cpp -o introduccion
```
which result in a executable named `introduccion`.
